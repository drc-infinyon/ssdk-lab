# ssdk-lab
Repository for InfinyOn tutorials to compose stateful streaming workflows with InfinyOn Stateful Service Development Kit (SSDK)

# What is SSDK?
Stateful Services combines data-centric functions with event streaming to automate data operations at scale. Built in Rust and powered by WebAssembly, Stateful Services engines are small, fast, and versatile, allowing you to write custom logic for data processing in Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust - any language compilable into WebAssembly.

# How to use this repo
This repo will have each end to end ssdk tutorial in it's own directory to copmplement docs, blogs, videos to help developers walk through the workflow of trying SSDK.
We will have separate workflows to run on [InfinyOn Cloud](https://infinyon.cloud/) Clusters and Local [Fluvio](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio) Clusters.
