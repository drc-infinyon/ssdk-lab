# ssdk-lab
Repository for InfinyOn tutorials to compose stateful streaming workflows with InfinyOn Stateful Service Development Kit (SSDK)

# What is SSDK?
Stateful Services combines data-centric functions with event streaming to automate data operations at scale. Built in Rust and powered by WebAssembly, Stateful Services engines are small, fast, and versatile, allowing you to write custom logic for data processing in Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust - any language compilable into WebAssembly.
